By using 2 ultrasonic Sonars, the robot is able to detect any motion in front of it, and rapidly adjust its position and follow the motion

By comparing the distance between what each sonar is measuring, the robot adjusts until both sonars are giving about the same measurement,
meaning that they are about the same distance from the object, and therefore, centralized

After the centralization is done, the robot follows its target until a distance of 5 cm and waits for new movement input
